# Catalyzer
Still working on a tag line, but we're here to have some more silly fun with cats. Images are served by The Cat API: https://thecatapi.com

## How It's Made

**Tech Used:** 
- ![vite](./src/assets/icons/vite.svg) Vite
- ![react](./src/assets/icons/react.svg) React
- ![html](./src/assets/icons/html.svg) HTML
- ![sass](./src/assets/icons/sass.svg) Sass
- ![typescript](./src/assets/icons/typescript.svg) TypeScript

This cat meme generator is a React project built with Vite. An Axios request to The Cat API retrieves a photo of either a random cat or a specific breed of cat. Details about the cat are provided by querying a database of random items that the developer had way too much fun creating.

## Optimizations

Wouldn't it be great to enjoy your random cat with friends? I would love to implement the ability to create a card that displays the image of your kitty and its fun facts for you to share on social media.

## Lessons Learned

This project is a marriage of my first cat meme generator, Cats On Demand, and Mayanwolfe's Doggo Generator. Instead of expanding features for COD, I decided to build a new project with some key differences:
- Vite vs. Create React App
- Sass vs. CSS
- Axios vs.Fetch API
- TypeScript vs. JavaScript
- The Cat API vs. Cataas

And of course I was greatly inspired by Doggo Generator and adapted those ideas into cat themes. You can find the original version here: https://mayanwolfe.github.io/Doggo-Generator
